			<h3>The Netherlands</h3>

			<h4>Amsterdam</h4>

					<h5>Amsterdam</h5>
					<p>For most tourists, their first experience of the Netherlands is Amsterdam, which happens to be a truly beautiful city that is small enough that you can easily walk or cycle to any of the neighborhoods and tourist sites. So go ahead and tire out your legs and feet at art museums, breweries, coffeeshops, gaping at prostitutes in the red light district - no one's here to judge - and be sure to take the time to stop by the small, canalside cafes and bars to have a coffee or beer and watch the canal boats and people. And don't skip a cruise along the canals. Whether you end up on a big tourist boat or are lucky enough to cruise on a smaller canal boat, it's a wonderful way to see the city.</p>

					<h5>Koningsdag</h5>
					<p>If you happen to be in Amsterdam on April 27, which is King's Day, be prepared for the biggest orange-themed street and canal party imaginable. It is a national holiday and all businesses close and everyone floods the city wearing orange. It feels like Amsterdam decided to throw a party and everyone came. Have you ever used a public toilet on the deck of a canal boat while house music blares from giant speakers? You may have after spending King's Day in Amsterdam.</p>

					<h5>The Kr&ouml;ller-M&uuml;ller Museum</h5>
					<p>Don't forget to look outside of Amsterdam! There are great day trips from Amsterdam that are only a short train journey away. If the weather forecast is good, definitely consider getting the train to Apeldorn and heading over the the The Kr&ouml;ller-M&uuml;ller Museum located in The Hoge Veluwe National Park. It is vast expanse of changing landscapes with areas of green grasss bordered by gently rolling sand dunes. Admission includes the use of a fleet of white bicycles so that you can fully access the sculpture garden, art museum, and national park. You just park a bike anywhere you want to stop and then grab another one when you want to ride again.</p>

					<h5>Oxford and beyond</h5>
					<p>If you are interested in seeing more of England than just London, Oxford is a good choice for getting out of the city. Oxford itself is quite small, but very beautiful and easily navigated by tourists. All of the historic colleges that make up the university are in the city center, as are numerous historic pubs, museums, and cafes. <a href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/whatson/visit/weston" target="_blank">The Weston Library</a> was recently revamped and now has wonderful exhibitions of rare books and manuscripts and a particularly good cafe in the lobby.</p>

					<h5>Edinburgh</h5>
					<p>Edinburgh is a beautiful, historic city packed with art galleries, museums, Holyrood Palace, and numerous other destinations. One of the lesser-known museums is the recently renovated <a href="https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Surgeons' Hall Museums.</a> Edinburgh has long been associated with medical studies and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh was founded in 1505. This museum is located in the city center and encompasses a pathology museum, surgery museum, and dental collectin and is well worth a visit. If you fancy a curry after your visit to the museum, the low-key favorite of many locals is just around the corner at <a href="http://www.kebab-mahal.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kebab Mahal,</a> or for slightly more upscale, vegetarian cuisine, <a href="http://www.kalpnarestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Kalpna</a> is only a few blocks away.</p>
